It was difficult at first trying to figure out what I wanted to start on. I wanted to go from top to bottom making sure I had my layout right, but I decided to put everything on the screen and work from there. It was hard to do the background image and add the div block right next to it, but it got easier when I had some help with it. I was very proud with myself how I was able to finish everything on time. This was a great assignment I was able to do"

If you're using a computer it will fit to your screen, if you're using a phone you'll be able to see the website just like on the computer. I think it's very useful to use so that you'll be able to see your website from many devices. When doing the Block family it was very fun being able to minimize and maximize my screen and change the colors for the screen. It was difficult at first to start doing this because you need really specific commands you want for the website to do and if you do it wrong it can mess up your whole entire design."

It seemed a little easier than html because you just placed var in front to name a variable type which was kind of an easier concept, but you had to name the different data types that you had to remember which is confusing to do. During the school day, when we came back, I was getting it. I now know the different data types-Boolean, String, Array, Object, Number, etc. I'm still getting the hang of it, but I think it's more efficient than html."

We had to test it in jsbin and it didn't work at first, but then me and my partner realized it was because one statement wasn't true so it wouldn't have worked. It was kind of difficult with my partner. I don't know my partner as well so it was weird to interact with him. It was like he was doing most of the work which was kind of hard to understand what I should be doing. I know how to work with people now, but it was really good to do."
