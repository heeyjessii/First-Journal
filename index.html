           <h3>Why I took this Class</h3>
            <p>I wanted to take this class because I thought it was interseting to find out how to code. I had an interseting in coding when I did code.org and scratch. I thought it was cool to keep trying.</p>
           <h3>What I want to get out of this class</h3>
           <p>I want to be able to able to code for FRC in Robotics because we use JavaScript. I think it will also help me create my own website the harder way compared to taking the easy way out and go on a website already created and make a new website.</p>

        <h2>UX vs UI</h2>

          <h3>Difference Between UX and UI</h3>
          <p>
          UX stands for User Experience. This is the experience people get when they entire a website.
          </p>
          <p>
          UI stands for User Interface. User Interface is suppose to be eye appealing for the user

          <h3>HTTP and CSS</h3>
            <p>
              HTTP is the language that describes the structure of Web pages like the headings, tables, photos, etc. CSS is the style sheet which includes colors, layouts and fonts.

        <h2> Responsive Design</h2>
        <h5>September 26, 2016</h5>
        <div class="article">
          <h3> What is a Responsive Web Design?</h3>
          <p>A Responsive Web Design is sites that can fit to all types of sizes. If I am making the screen smaller or bigger it's able to adjust to the screen size so I can see all the content. For example Facebook allows you see all the content if you have the screen at a regular size or if you make it smaller.  </p>

        <h2>Digimon Go</h2>

        <div class="article">
          <h3>Reflection on Digimon Go</h3>
          <p>Doing a clone on Digimon Go was very interesting. It was surprising when I was able to create a website that was replicated to another one. It was difficult at first trying to figure out what I wanted to start on. I wanted to go from top to bottom making sure I had my layout right, but I decided to put everything on the screen and work from there. It was hard to do the background image and add the div block right next to it, but it got easier when I had some help with it. I was very proud with myself how I was able to finish everything on time. This was a great assignment I was able to do</p>

        <h2> CSS Media Queries</h2>
        <h5>October 7, 2016</h5>
        <div class="article">
          <h3>Reflection on Media Queries</h3>
          <p> CSS Media Queries are used to make the website fit to your screen. If you're using a computer it will fit to your screen, if you're using a phone you'll be able to see the website just like on the computer. I think it's very useful to use so that you'll be able to see your website from many devices. When doing the Block family it was very fun being able to minimize and maximize my screen and change the colors for the screen.  </p>
