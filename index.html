         <h3>Why I took this Class</h3>
          <p>I wanted to take this class because I thought it was interseting to find out how to code. I had an interseting in coding when I did code.org and I thought it was cool to keep trying.</p>

         <h3>What I want to get out of this class</h3>
         <p>I want to be able to able to code for FRC in Robotics because we use JavaScript. I think it will also help me create my own website the harder way compared to taking the easy way out and go on a website already created and make a new website.</p>
